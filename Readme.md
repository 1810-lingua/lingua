This is our language learning system, Lingua. Lingua is a multiplatform application linking a Google Chrome extension with a native mobile application to reinforce language study and vocabulary practice through immersion. Users will be able to select words and phrases to learn, practice them on mobile, and then have those words and phrases replaced in their internet browsing, reinforcing their study.
